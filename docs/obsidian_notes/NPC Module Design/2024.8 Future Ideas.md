# Godot
- Create templates for defining NPCs or new types of objects using a text file. This will make it easier to define unique scenarios

# NPC Logic
- Mind wandering. Occasionally sample random events (maybe weighted by salience) from the NPCs memory in interactions. Make random thoughts more likely when the NPCs needs are lower
- Could use a multimodal model to process sensory input. Maybe use a vision-language model as a sort of QA answering service. As part of RAG, the LLM can pose questions about the visual layout
- Create documentation about how the simulation works. Include this in the semantic memory of AIs including NPCs and the gamemaster
- Retrieval system:
	- Allow the agent to formulate SQL or SQL-like queries
	- Maintain a dynamic list of tags, which can be used to narrow down searches
		- Allow the agent to add tags as desired to some maximum limit (then ask it to remove irrelevant tags)
		- Run a Tag Daemon to continually tag new / untagged memories
			- Check tags first for higher importance memories which are missing more types of tags
			- For each tag, calculate a $\text{tagScore} = \text{importanceScore} * (1 - \frac{\text{numTagsChecked}}{\text{totalTags}})$, and query for the highest $\text{tagScore}$ every time the Tag Daemon finishes checking a memory
- Memories involving other NPCs should be boosted / deboosted depending on the NPCs relationship with the NPCs in the memory
- For when NPCs are able to process sensory data (probably auditory and visual): when they are significant enough, current sensory inputs should be saved as memories. They can be indexed by multimodal embeddings

LLM interface
- Standardized interface to interact with local LLMs or LLM APIs

Retrieval interface
- Standardized interface to pull relevant memories given a query (could include natural language, filters)
- Boosting and reranking should be done in separate modular components (think about a computational graph -- nodes should have a single-responsibility)

Simulation interface
- Standardized interface to send updates to and receive updates from the simulator

Websocket/server
- Could potentially use AutoGen functionality for this https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/io/websockets

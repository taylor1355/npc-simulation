# Future Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines a high-level testing strategy for the NPC simulation project. As the project moves from prototyping to production, we need to establish testing practices that ensure reliability, improve debuggability, and support rapid development.

## Current State

The project is in early prototyping phase with:
- Manual testing as the primary validation method
- Limited debugging tools (basic console)
- Ad-hoc logging throughout the codebase
- No automated test infrastructure

## Testing Philosophy

### Priorities
1. **Debuggability First**: Better tools for understanding what went wrong
2. **Scenario Reproducibility**: Ability to recreate specific game states
3. **Regression Prevention**: Catch breaking changes early
4. **Developer Velocity**: Tests should speed up, not slow down development

### Challenges in Godot

- GDScript's testing ecosystem is less mature than other languages
- Node-based architecture makes traditional unit testing challenging
- Signal-based communication complicates test isolation
- Limited mocking capabilities for engine types
- Scene dependencies require special handling

## Proposed Testing Layers

### 1. Unit Testing
Focus on testing pure logic that can be isolated from Godot's node system:
- Calculation functions (need decay, damage formulas)
- Data structures and algorithms
- Utility functions (ID generation, string formatting)
- Component configuration validation

### 2. Integration Testing
Test interactions between systems:
- Event flow verification
- Multi-system scenarios (e.g., concurrent interactions)
- State machine transitions
- Save/load integrity

### 3. Scenario Testing
High-level tests that validate gameplay:
- Predefined world states with expected outcomes
- Stress tests (many NPCs, complex interactions)
- Edge case scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

## Developer Tooling Roadmap

### Enhanced Debug Console
- Powerful query language for inspecting game state
- Ability to save and load specific scenarios
- Time control (pause, slow motion, fast forward)
- Record and replay functionality
- Runtime assertions and invariant checking

### Structured Logging System
- Categorized logging (NPC behavior, interactions, UI, performance)
- Log levels with runtime filtering
- Contextual logging (track specific NPCs or interactions)
- Log analysis tools for pattern detection
- Export capabilities for external analysis

### Test Automation Infrastructure
- Scene-based test fixtures
- Automated scenario execution
- Regression test suite
- Performance tracking over time
- Test result reporting

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Logging & Debug Tools)
Build the infrastructure that makes testing possible:
- Implement structured logging system
- Enhance debug console with testing commands
- Create scenario save/load system
- Add runtime inspection tools

### Phase 2: Manual Testing Enhancement
Improve the manual testing experience:
- Scenario library for common test cases
- Reproducible bug reporting tools
- State inspection and modification
- Visual debugging aids

### Phase 3: Automated Testing Introduction
Begin automating critical paths:
- Choose appropriate testing framework
- Create test helpers and utilities
- Write tests for core systems
- Set up continuous testing

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Coverage
Expand testing to cover entire system:
- Integration test suites
- Performance regression tests
- Visual testing capabilities
- Load and stress testing

## Framework Considerations

### Available Options
- **GUT (Godot Unit Testing)**: Mature community framework
- **gdUnit4**: Modern framework with Godot 4 support
- **Custom Solution**: Tailored to our specific needs
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine tools as appropriate

### Selection Criteria
- Godot 4.3+ compatibility
- Maintenance and community support
- Integration with our architecture
- Learning curve for team
- Performance overhead

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (3 months)
- Debugging time reduced by 50%
- All critical bugs reproducible via scenarios
- Core systems have basic test coverage
- New developers can run test suite

### Long Term (1 year)
- Automated tests catch 80% of regressions
- Full scenario library for edge cases
- Performance tracked and optimized
- Testing integrated into development workflow

## Open Questions

1. **Framework Selection**: Which testing framework best fits our needs?
2. **Test Granularity**: How fine-grained should our tests be?
3. **Performance Testing**: How do we measure and ensure performance?
4. **Visual Testing**: Can we automate testing of visual correctness?
5. **Test Data Management**: How do we manage test scenarios and fixtures?
6. **CI/CD Integration**: When and how to add continuous testing?

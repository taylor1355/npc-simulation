# Project Structure
The simulation logic and NPC logic will be separated into two different codebases.
### Simulation Logic
The simulation will be implemented in a game engine, namely Godot. The simulation will be in the style of a top down 2D RPG with pixelated graphics. The aesthetic should be similar to Stardew Valley or Pok√©mon. The gameplay systems (meaning the things NPC / player agents can do) will at first be reminiscent of the Sims. More breadth and depth can be added once a polished minimum viable prototype is finished.
### NPC Logic
The NPC service should be built using a Langchain-like library to make complex LLM flows easier to implement. Every time it receives observations for the entity AIs and game state information, it will compute the thoughts / actions of each AI, consulting the gamemaster when necessary.
- Look into using some sort of data store which is indexable using both vector search and SQL queries. This could be used by NPCs as their memory and by the gamemaster to perform RAG using event history, simulation rules, etc.
- Use something similar to [LM Studio Server](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/local-server) to easily access one or more local LLMs through a simple API. https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm may be a better alternative
### Intercommunication
The simulation is responsible for sending to the NPC module: (a) the observations of each entity with an attached AI and (b) the current state + a state diff (between $t$ and $t-1$) for the gamemaster each game tick. The NPC module is responsible for , the simulation should receive a list of actions to implement.

# Resources
### Godot
- https://www.youtube.com/c/gdquest
- https://github.com/godotengine/godot-vscode-plugin
- https://github.com/BenjaTK/Gaea
	- Provides extensive procedural generation functionality
- https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera
	- Will be useful to easily get nice behavior when following the player with the camera
- https://github.com/limbonaut/limboai
	- Could be useful to give agents a higher level way of interacting with the world
- https://opengameart.org/content/moderna-graphical-interface
	- Could start out with an off-the-shelf set of UI icons like this to build out the in-game UI, then customize/replace components in a later style pass
- Tips
	- Preferably find a open source RPG to refer to and copy code from
	- Make sure to turn on advanced settings
	- Can use y-sort to simulate occlusion
	- Hold alt to drag the currently selected object(s)
	- Changing scenes is a pain in the ass. It can be better to put everything on a single scene (tobi used trick where he made ui elements a child of the camera)
	- First scope out the specific mechanics you want, then implement a mechanic at a time and test in isolation. Finally, put all the mechanics into a level to test together
- Talking to Python:
	- Connect to a local Python webserver using web sockets on Godot
	- Use Python bindings for Godot to directly import the NPC service as a module
### NPC Service
- List of helpful papers: [[Useful Papers#Generative Agents]]
- Gemini 1.5 Flash and Pro (https://ai.google.dev/pricing) seem quite promising https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/s/G7RQBZ1Smd
- VLLM for serving multiple LoRAs of the same model
### Finetuning Logistics
- If you need more compute than what's available on your local machine, look into Modal Labs or similar.

# Minimum Viable Prototype
### Scope-setting
- Create a hardcoded simulation area already fully populated with entities. No need to worry about creating new entities at first.

### Initial development phases
Game mechanics
- Phase 1: Core game mechanics
- Phase 2: Conversation / social mechanics
- Phase 3: Some sort of low-level interface between the gamemaster and the simulation state, which allows the gamemaster to execute novel interactions
- Phase 4: Refactor as many things as possible in the game to be easily hackable by the human player and the gamemaster
	- Create a scenario editor so that players can customize mechanics without editing the source code or creating mods
	- Allow customizing the gamemaster behavior by giving it general instructions and optionally instructions/background on a per-entity basis (e.g., a particular entity is lucky so anything involving chance should go a bit better for them).
	- Allow the creation and customization of entities. Entities include inanimate objects, NPCs, and player-controlled characters. Entities should be created from pre-existing templates to make it more feasible to do programmatically.
NPC AI
- Phase 1: Placeholder logic (simple logic controlling taking actions / moving around). This will be useful for nailing down an initial set of simple game systems
- Phase 2: Implement AI agent logic, NPCs can only interact using preprogrammed interfaces. This will be useful for iterating on the AI agent logic without bothering with the gamemaster.
	- Look for a project like the Generative Agents repo but with better starting code as a starting point.
	- LLM controls the transitions of a state machine. Each state represents a preprogrammed pattern of behavior. The LLM can choose to interrupt the current state and directly control the NPC (i.e., use more fine-grained actions) at any time.
- Phase 3: NPCs can interact in novel ways with the help of the gamemaster
Gamemaster
- Phase 3: Facilitate novel interactions (not already implemented using preprogrammed interfaces) between entities
- Phase 4: Take action in the world based on user instructions provided at the beginning of the simulation

### Phase 1 Implementation Details
#### Core Game Mechanics
Foundations
- Create main scene with TileMap
- Create NPC scene with Sprite2D, etc
- Integrate GamePiece, GameBoard, Pathfinder scripts from OpenRPG to allow tile-based movement and pathing
- Study design patterns from OpenRPG to figure out how to best organize future mechanics
Hunger
- Hunger need:
	- Hunger slowly increases over time. Some activities speed up the rate of hunger
	- NPCs should path to food when their hunger dips below a threshold
- Basic inventory system
- Food objects:
	- Initial properties: sprite, amount of hunger replenished, name. 
	- When in grabbing distance, NPC can consume food object (either set down somewhere or in the fridge) or add it to their inventory.
- Refrigerator objects
Hygiene
- Hygiene Need:
    - Define hygiene as a need that decreases over time.
    - Create actions (e.g., taking a shower, washing hands) that NPCs can perform to increase hygiene.
    - Implement a threshold for hygiene where NPCs will seek out hygiene-related actions when it gets too low.
- Add hygiene-related objects (e.g., sinks, showers) with interaction scripts.
Fun
- Fun Need:
    - Define fun as a need that decreases over time.
    - Create actions (e.g., watching TV, playing games) that NPCs can perform to increase fun.
    - Implement a threshold for fun where NPCs will seek out fun-related actions when it gets too low.
- Add fun-related objects (e.g., TVs, gaming consoles) with interaction scripts.
Energy
- Energy Need:
    - Define energy as a need that decreases over time and through certain actions (e.g., working).
    - Create actions (e.g., sleeping, napping) that NPCs can perform to increase energy.
    - Implement a threshold for energy where NPCs will seek out energy-related actions when it gets too low.
- Add energy-related objects (e.g., beds, sofas) with interaction scripts.
Mood
- Mood Calculation:
    - Calculate mood based on the current state of needs (hunger, hygiene, fun, energy).
    - Define mood states (e.g., happy, neutral, sad) with corresponding visual indicators.
    - Script to update mood dynamically based on changes in needs.
Player Money (Job, Upgrading Furniture)
- Job Mechanic:
	- Implement a time system where NPCs teleport to work at 9 am and return at 5 pm.
    - Script for earning currency when NPCs go to work.
    - Display current currency in the UI.
- Upgrading Furniture:
       - Create a script to manage furniture properties and upgrades.
    - Define upgrade costs and effects on NPC needs.
    - Implement UI elements for upgrading furniture and display current currency.
Basic AI (Decision Trees for NPC Behavior)
- Implement decision trees to manage NPC behavior based on current needs and mood.
- Script for prioritizing actions (e.g., eating, sleeping) depending on the urgency of needs.
Aesthetics
- Building system. Support walls, buildings, rooms like the sims but simplified
- Different floor surfaces and wall coverings

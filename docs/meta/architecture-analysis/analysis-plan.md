# Architecture Analysis Plan

## Objective
Analyze the NPC Simulation codebase to identify opportunities for:
1. Improved extensibility without speculative features
2. Automation strategies to reduce development time
3. Technical debt reduction that directly impacts development velocity

## Analysis Phases

### Phase 1: High-Level Architecture Understanding
- [ ] Core system architecture and dependencies
- [ ] Design patterns and architectural decisions
- [ ] Integration points and extension mechanisms
- [ ] Event flow and communication patterns

### Phase 2: Subsystem Deep Dives
- [ ] Component system effectiveness
- [ ] Interaction system flexibility
- [ ] NPC decision architecture
- [ ] UI system extensibility
- [ ] Data-driven configuration patterns

### Phase 3: Development Workflow Analysis
- [ ] Common development tasks and pain points
- [ ] Repetitive patterns that could be automated
- [ ] Configuration vs code balance
- [ ] Testing and debugging workflows

### Phase 4: Technical Debt Assessment
- [ ] Review existing technical debt documentation
- [ ] Identify high-impact debt items
- [ ] Assess refactoring cost vs benefit
- [ ] Prioritize based on development velocity impact

### Phase 5: Recommendations
- [ ] Architectural improvements
- [ ] Automation opportunities
- [ ] Tooling suggestions
- [ ] Process improvements

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Extensibility**
   - How easy is it to add new item types?
   - How easy is it to add new NPC behaviors?
   - How easy is it to add new interaction types?
   - What are the common extension points?

2. **Development Speed**
   - What tasks take the most time?
   - What patterns are repeated frequently?
   - Where do developers get stuck?
   - What could be automated?

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Which debt items most impact development?
   - What refactoring would have highest ROI?
   - Are there architectural bottlenecks?

## Success Metrics
- Time to implement new features
- Code reuse percentage
- Configuration vs custom code ratio
- Developer cognitive load

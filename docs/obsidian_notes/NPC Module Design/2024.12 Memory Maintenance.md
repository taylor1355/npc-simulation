This assumes that NPCs have working memory (moment to moment), medium term memory (text summary of a recent slice of the past -- for the NPC simulation, likely this will include daily memory, weekly memory, monthly memory, and yearly memory), and long-term memory.

During memory maintenance, the NPC will:
- Integrate working memory into medium-term memory, medium-term memory into higher level medium-term memory (if applicable), and medium-term memory into long term memory.
- Randomly sample long-term memories based on the medium-term memory to seed the working memory for the next day.

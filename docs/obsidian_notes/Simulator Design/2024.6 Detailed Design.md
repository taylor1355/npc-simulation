	- Use composition to create easily reusable functionality. For example, each item could have a list called on_consume, which has a list of effects on the consuming NPC when the item is consumed (and the item is non-consumable if on_consume is empty). To make sure the specific system you design is flexible. Make sure to write out a bunch of example use-cases and check that they will work under your system.

	- Separate the item system from the effect system 
		- The effect system manages a collection of effects. Each effect has a unique ID (the ID can be either string or integer, whatever), and implement an interface, e.g IEffect. IEffect has a function, something like, void perform(Item * item); When you add new effect, just implement IEffect and add the interface to effect system.  
		  - The item system manages a collection of items. The items can be read from database, or added by code. An item holds a collection of effect IDs. When you want to do the effect, just ask the effect system with the effect ID, and the call IEffect::perform with the given item. With this design, your item only knows an effect ID. It doesn't care what's the effect, or how effect works.
